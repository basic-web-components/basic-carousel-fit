<!--
Lets the user navigate laterally through a sequence of child elements, without
requiring that an explicit height and width be applied to the carousel.

basic-carousel-fit is a variant of the
[basic-carousel](http://github.com/basic-web-components/basic-carousel)
component. That component requires that you use styling to explicitly set a
height and width on the carousel. In contrast, basic-carousel-fit automatically
examines its child elements, determines their maximum height and width, and then
sets its own size accordingly.

Example: if a basic-carousel-fit contains three child images of different sizes:

    <basic-carousel-fit>
      <img src="small.jpg">
      <img src="medium.jpg">
      <img src="large.jpg">
    </basic-carousel-fit>

it will size itself to the largest image.

In all other respects, basic-carousel-fit works identically to basic-carousel;
see that component for complete details on behavior and other notes.

The fact that basic-carousel and basic-carousel-fit are distinct is an interim
strategy. It is hoped that, at some point, they can be unified to create a
single carousel that adapts its layout behavior to its applied styling.
